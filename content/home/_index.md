_vMenu is a server-sided trainer/menu for FiveM servers, allowing server owners to configure it almost completely using simple permissions._




## Getting Started
So, you've decided to install vMenu on your FiveM server. Great!... now what?!

If this is your first time installing vMenu (or you're completely new at installing FiveM resources) then follow the instructions on the [Installation](/vmenu/installation/) page!

If you already know the basics of installing resources (make sure you name the resource folder `vMenu` otherwise this resource will break) continue reading over at the Permissions or Configuration pages.



## Easy installation using ZAP Hosting
If you don't want to install vMenu yourself, then get a ZAP Hosting FiveM server using the link below, and install vMenu through their 1-click installer! Don't forget to use the code `Vespura-a-3715` at checkout for a 10% discount!

**Click [here to get a FiveM server from ZAP Hosting](https://zap-hosting.com/vespura2) and use the one-click installer from the control panel.**
