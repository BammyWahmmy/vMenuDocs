_vMenu is a server-sided trainer/menu for FiveM servers, allowing server owners to configure it almost completely using simple permissions._


{{% notice warning%}}
**IMPORTANT**: If you're having issues with vMenu crashing on your (Linux) server, it's recommended to update to vMenu v3.3.0-pre or above. More info [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases/tag/v3.3.0-pre).

## Getting Started
So, you've decided to install vMenu on your FiveM server. Great!... now what?!

If this is your first time installing vMenu (or you're completely new at installing FiveM resources) then follow the instructions on the [Installation](/vmenu/installation/) page!

If you already know the basics of installing resources (make sure you name the resource folder `vMenu` otherwise this resource will break) continue reading over at the Permissions or Configuration pages.
